3: UNRELIABLE VALUE: Future (‘<none>’) unexpectedly generated random numbers without specifying argument '[future.]seed'. There is a risk that those random numbers are not statistically sound and the overall results might be invalid. To fix this, specify argument '[future.]seed', e.g. 'seed=TRUE'. This ensures that proper, parallel-safe random numbers are produced via the L'Ecuyer-CMRG method. To disable this check, use [future].seed=NULL, or set option 'future.rng.onMisuse' to "ignore".
